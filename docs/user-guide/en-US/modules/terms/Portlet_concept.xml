		<para>
			A portlet is a small, self-contained web application. Portlets are managed and displayed within a Portal. Typically, a <emphasis>portal</emphasis> page is displayed as a collection of non-overlapping <emphasis>portlet</emphasis> windows, with each portlet window displaying a different portlet. Hence a portlet (or collection of portlets) resembles a web-based application hosted in a portal.

		<para>
			Portlets can be configured to generated differing content and &PRODUCT; has a number of default portlets that can be used in any portal built in the application.
